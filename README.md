# Sarcasm Detection using Deep Learning
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d4cdba8-fc02-4782-8848-93f17fa1b638)



## Abstract
Sarcasm is the use of words intended to convey the opposite meaning, often to offend, irritate, or amuse. This project aims to recognize sarcasm in plain text using Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning techniques. The challenge lies in identifying sarcasm without contextual cues like tone, facial expressions, or body language. Our solution leverages machine learning models to distinguish between regular and sarcastic sentences.

## Introduction
Sentiment analysis combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) with machine learning to identify underlying sentiments in text. Sarcasm plays a crucial role in human social interaction and can significantly impact sentiment analysis results. Our project focuses on developing a reliable sarcasm detection system to improve sentiment analysis accuracy.

### Key Features:
- Binary classification of sarcastic vs. non-sarcastic text
- Deep learning-based approach
- Web application interface
- Context-aware analysis

## Literature Survey
We examined existing systems and their limitations:

### Existing Approaches:
1. Contrast-based methods (positive/negative sentiment analysis)
2. Linguistic pattern recognition
3. Prosodic and structural variations
4. Contextual and environmental expertise

### Limitations Identified:
- Contextual understanding challenges
- Dataset bias issues
- Ambiguity in sarcastic expressions
- Class imbalance problems
- Cultural variations in sarcasm

## Proposed System
Our solution addresses these challenges through a comprehensive approach:

### System Architecture
1. **Data Collection**: Compiled diverse dataset of sarcastic/non-sarcastic text
2. **Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, punctuation handling
3. **Feature Extraction**: Word embeddings for semantic understanding
4. **Model Selection**: Evaluated RNNs, CNNs, and Transformer models
5. **Training & Evaluation**: Used accuracy, precision, recall metrics
6. **Deployment**: Web application for practical use

### Technical Specifications
**Software Requirements:**
- OS: Windows
- Language: Python
- IDE: VS Code
- Libraries: Streamlit, Pandas, NLTK, re, string

**Hardware Requirements:**
- Processor: Intel i3 2.7GHz+
- RAM: 4GB+
- Storage: 256GB+

## Results
Our model demonstrates promising performance in sarcasm detection:
- Achieved high accuracy in controlled environments
- Successfully identified contextual sarcasm cues
- Web application provides user-friendly interface

## Conclusion
Sarcasm detection remains a challenging aspect of sentiment analysis. Our deep learning approach shows promising results, though challenges like cultural variations and dataset bias persist. Future work will focus on:
- Multimodal analysis (text + visual cues)
- Cross-language sarcasm detection
- Improved context understanding
